Description: Easily add a searchbar widget to your R Shiny application. The
  searchbar is similar to a textInput widget but adds more interaction and
  user feedback. The widget quickly integrates with any existing Shiny or
  HTML element (using its id attribute) to highlight and cycle through
  keyword matches. The searchbar uses mark.js to highlight the user's input.
  The searchbar can cycle through multiple instances of the match and
  automatically scroll to the correct position and provide the user quick
  feedback as to how many matches have been made or which match is currently
  being looked at.
