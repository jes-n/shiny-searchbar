Description: ShinySearchbar easily adds a searchbar to your R Shiny app. The
    searchbar is similar to a textInput widget but adds more interaction and
    user feedback. The widget quickly integrates with any existing Shiny or
    HTML element identified by an id to highlight and cycle through matches.
    The searchbar uses mark.js to highlight the user's input, but offers much
    more functionality than just that. The searchbar can cycle through multiple
    instances of the match and automatically scroll to the correct position,
    called the `cycler`. The search bar can also provide the user quick
    feedback as to how many matches have been made or which match is currently
    being looked at, call the `counter`.
