Description: Add a searchbar widget to your R Shiny application. The widget
  quickly integrates with any existing element containing text to highlight
  matches. Highlighting is done with the JavaScript library mark.js. The widget
  includes buttons to cycle through multiple instances of the match and
  automatically scroll to the matches in an overflow element (or window). The
  widget also displays the total number of matches and which match is currently
  being cycled through. The widget is structured as a Bootstrap 3 input group.
